Rep Tester
==========
This tool is intended as simple <b>Reps</b> tester. It connects to the backend
runnning in <i>this</i> browser. It attaches to the first tab running in this
browser so, make sure this page is <i>not</i> the first tab otherwise it
would attach to itself and cause the browser to freeze. This is known limitation
and it'll be fixed later.
